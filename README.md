If you click(doubleclick) inside the rectangle, a random shape of random colour will be generated at mouse position and start
falling.
If you click a shape, it will disappear.

In the top left you will have two HTML text fields, one showing the number of shapes being displayed in the
rectangle. The other text field shows the surface area (in px^2) occupied by the shapes.
In the bottom you will add a couple of controls (HTML):
-/+ increase or decrease the number of shapes generated per second (update the text field accordingly)
-/+ increase or decrease the gravity value (update the text value accordingly)
